* Using Kotlin Flow with Room Database.
* Making two network calls in parallel using Kotlin Flow.
* Doing task in series using Kotlin Flow.
* Unit test in Flow.

### Kotlin Flow Examples for Android Development:
* **Single Network Call:**  Learn how to make a network call using Kotlin Flow. This is a very simple use-case in Android App Development.
    * [Activity Code](app/src/main/java/com/mindorks/kotlinFlow/learn/retrofit/single/SingleNetworkCallActivity.kt)
    * [ViewModel Code](app/src/main/java/com/mindorks/kotlinFlow/learn/retrofit/single/SingleNetworkCallViewModel.kt)
 
* **Series Network Call:**  Learn how to make network calls in series using Kotlin Flow. This is useful when you want to make a network call which is dependent on an another network call.
    * [Activity Code](app/src/main/java/com/mindorks/kotlinFlow/learn/retrofit/series/SeriesNetworkCallsActivity.kt)
    * [ViewModel Code](app/src/main/java/com/mindorks/kotlinFlow/learn/retrofit/series/SeriesNetworkCallsViewModel.kt)

* **Parallel Network Call:**  Learn how to make network calls in parallel using Kotlin Flow. This is useful when you want to make a network call which is dependent on an another network call.
    * [Activity Code](app/src/main/java/com/mindorks/kotlinFlow/learn/retrofit/parallel/ParallelNetworkCallsActivity.kt)
    * [ViewModel Code](app/src/main/java/com/mindorks/kotlinFlow/learn/retrofit/parallel/ParallelNetworkCallsViewModel.kt)

* **Room Database Operation:** Learn how to fetch or insert entity in database using Kotlin Flow. This is useful when you are using Room Database in your Android Application.
    * [Activity Code](app/src/main/java/com/mindorks/kotlinFlow/learn/room/RoomDBActivity.kt)
    * [ViewModel Code](app/src/main/java/com/mindorks/kotlinFlow/learn/room/RoomDBViewModel.kt) 

* **Long Running Task:** Learn how to do a long running task using Kotlin Flow. If you want to do any of your task in background thread using the Kotlin Flow, then this is useful.
    * [Activity Code](app/src/main/java/com/mindorks/kotlinFlow/learn/task/onetask/LongRunningTaskActivity.kt)
    * [ViewModel Code](app/src/main/java/com/mindorks/kotlinFlow/learn/task/onetask/LongRunningTaskViewModel.kt)
